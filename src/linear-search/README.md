# Linear Search

Simple search algorithm that iterates over a list of elements to find the index of an element passed in as
a parameter. If the element is not found in the list then -1 is returned.

Worst-case performacne:        O(n)  
Best-case performance:         O(1)  
Average performance:           O(n)  
Worst-case space complexity:   O(1)
