/**
 * Linear Search
 * --------------
 * Simple search algorithm that iterates over a list of elements to find the index of an element passed in as
 * a parameter. If the element is not found in the list then -1 is returned.
 *
 * Worst-case performacne:        O(n)
 * Best-case performance:         O(1)
 * Average performance:           O(n)
 * Worst-case space complexity:   O(1)
 *
 * @param {number[]} list - The list of elements that will be searched.
 * @param {number} element  - The element that will be searched for inside the list.
 *
 * @return number - The index of the element if it is found in the list. -1 is returned if element isn't found.
